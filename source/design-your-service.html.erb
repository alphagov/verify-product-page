        </h1>
        <p>
          GOV.UK Verify will be part of your service’s user journey, so you need to consider where and how you will send users to that part of the journey
        </p>
        <p>
          See all the steps involved in the GOV.UK Verify user journey for a:

        <h2 class="heading-large">
          Where to put GOV.UK Verify in your user journey
        </h2>
        <p>
          Your service should send users to GOV.UK Verify at the point you need to check their identity. For most services, this will be at the start of the journey, but some services may allow users to enter some information first, for example to confirm their eligibility.

          Use GOV.UK Verify at the start of your service when:
        </p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>
            your service contains sensitive data that should only be visible to a verified user
          </li>
          <li>
            you want the user’s name, date of birth and address (entered during the verification process) to be passed to the service without the user needing to submit it a second time
          </li>
          <li>
            you want users to be able to save their progress and return later
          </li>
          <li>
            you want to filter out users who are unable to verify their identity with GOV.UK Verify so they can be directed to another way of using your service
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="heading-medium">
          Using GOV.UK Verify later in the service
        </h3>
        <p>
          Some services put GOV.UK Verify later in their user journey. This means users can complete as much of your service as possible before they need to verify their identity.

          Use GOV.UK Verify later in the service when:
        </p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>
            you want to check users’ eligibility to use a service before checking their identity
          </li>
          <li>
            your service has other ways for users to verify their identity, such as face-to-face in a government office – they can complete parts of the service online before finishing the later stages somewhere else
          </li>
        </ul>

          How to send users to GOV.UK Verify from your service
        </h2>
        <p>
          Usually, your service should send your users to the GOV.UK Verify sign-in page. This page will tell users that they can use your service with either:
        </p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>
            GOV.UK Verify
          </li>
          <li>
            a digital identity from another European country
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <img class="content-section__image image-border" src="/images/pattern-standard.png" alt="Screenshot of the GOV.UK Verify sign-in page">
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-medium">
          If your service lets users sign in another way
        </h3>
        <p>
          Use the <a href="https://verify-rd-patterns.cloudapps.digital/multiple-signin">multiple sign-in page pattern</a> if users can sing in to your service using something other than GOV.UK Verify or a digital identity from another European country. For example, users can sign into some HM Revenue &amp; Customs services with Government Gateway as well.

        </p>
        <p>
          You can use the <a href="https://verify-rd-patterns.cloudapps.digital/create-account">create an account pattern</a> to show new users how to create accounts for the different ways of using your service.

        <h3 class="heading-medium">
          If a user cannot be verified
        </h3>
        <p>
          GOV.UK Verify will show any users who cannot be verified the other ways they can use your service, for example by phone or by post.
