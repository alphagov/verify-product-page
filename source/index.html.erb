            How GOV.UK Verify works
          </h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            GOV.UK Verify works with different organisations, known as identity providers (or certified companies), to prove users’ identities.
          </p>
          <p class="govuk-body">
            When signing into your service for the first time, users will be asked to set up an account for one of these companies. They’ll ask the user to provide evidence and answer questions about themselves.
          </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
              Identity providers check the details users provide against records held by organisations like credit agencies.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can choose from different levels of identity assurance (confidence that users are who they say they are) depending on whether a risk assessment suggests your service faces a high or low risk of identity fraud.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users can use their identity account to easily sign in to your service again and access other government services that use GOV.UK Verify.
            </li>
            <li>
              User data is protected to a high standard.
            </li>
            <li>
              GOV.UK Verify continually monitors for identity fraud.
            </li>
